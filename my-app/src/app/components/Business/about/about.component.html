	<h6>Customer Promises:</h6>
	<ol>
		<li>
		I will do my very best to curate and provide quality travel experiences within your desired budget.
		</li>
		
		<li>
		I will not promote a trip or service that is beneath my own personal travel tastes and standards within your requested price range (unless you insist).
		</li>
		
		<li>
		I will never push or pressure you to book anything. I will book only when you are ready and comfortable with the product or service proposed.
		</li>
		
		<li>
		No quote is ever guaranteed, since market prices and availability can change at any minute. If your package price changes, I will do my absolute best to find you a package with an equal or lesser price at an equal or greater quality if available.
		</li>
		
		<li>
		I promise to put your well-being and enjoyment over profit, meaning that I will not try to sell you products that do not fit your travel needs and wants, for my own gain.
		</li>
		
		<li>
		I promise to provide you the best customer service that I can, and will give you the genuine courtesy and care that you deserve.
		</li>
		
		<li>
		If I am unable to provide the desired product or service, I will point you in the direction of an someone of repute that can.
		</li>
