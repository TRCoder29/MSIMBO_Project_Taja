	Mission Statement Under Construction

	<!-- Customer Promises: Heading and Description -->
	Customer Promises:
	1. I will do my very best to curate and provide quality travel experiences within your desired budget.
	
	2. I will not promote a trip or service that is beneath my own personal travel tastes and standards within your requested price range (unless you insist).
	
	3. I will never push or pressure you to book anything. I will book only when you are ready and comfortable with the product or service proposed.
	
	4. No quote is ever guaranteed, since market prices and availability can change at any minute. If your package price changes, I will do my absolute best to find you a package with an equal or lesser price at an equal or greater quality if available.
	
	5. I promise to put your well-being and enjoyment over profit, meaning that I will not try to sell you products that do not fit your travel needs and wants, for my own gain.
	
	6. I promise to provide you the best customer service that I can, and will give you the genuine courtesy and care that you deserve.
	
	7. If I am unable to provide the desired product or service, I will point you in the direction of an someone of repute that can.
